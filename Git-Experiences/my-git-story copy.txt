I have been using git from last 6 months. My best tip is "First learn Git!"


There is very funny story of mine:

I didn't knew how to revert back changes in Git. 
To revert changes I aleays used git checkout <code>!
One day when I used my head got deatached and I had no idea about that and started to code in deatached head.
When I wrote around 150 lines of code in different file. I was trying to commit changes but it was not working.
I searched on Google and did what Stack Overflow said and lost my changes!!!!

Then I first watched the complete course of git on Youtube then I am doing pretty good in it.


Sorry, For my English!!
